# Polylogical Operations Example
# Demonstrates how logical operators work differently across tracks

# Define tracks
track main period 1 using classical
track slow period 4 using fuzzy
track syncop period 7 using paraconsistent

# Create truth values
tv danger = 0.7
tv safety = 0.4

# Polylogical AND operation
# This will use classical AND on main, fuzzy AND on slow, etc.
tv assessment = 0.0

# Set track-specific values
danger.main = 0.9
danger.slow = 0.7
danger.syncop = 0.5

safety.main = 0.3
safety.slow = 0.6
safety.syncop = 0.8

# Compute AND across tracks (each uses its own logic)
assessment = danger and safety

print(assessment)
